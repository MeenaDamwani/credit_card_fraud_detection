# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Support Vector Machine Model and PowerBI Visualization 

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using historical transaction data from the USA. The dataset is highly imbalanced, and various techniques were employed to ensure accurate and efficient fraud detection.

## Objective
The goal is to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent based on transaction features, helping financial institutions reduce fraud and improve security measures.

## Contents
- **Code**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building.
- **Datasets**: Processed datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Visualizations summarizing customer churn analysis.

## Power BI File
The **Power BI Dashboard** file is too large to include directly in the repository. It is available in the **Releases** section of this repository.

## Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset and performed feature engineering using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
- **Data Balancing**: Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to balance the imbalanced dataset and improve model performance.
- **Modeling**: Built and trained multiple classification models, including **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** , optimizing them with **Cross- 
   Validation**.
- **Model Evaluation**: Achieved an **84% accuracy** in predicting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.


## Tools and Technologies
- **Python** (for model development and data manipulation)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning al
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning algorithms)
