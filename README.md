# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using historical transaction data from the USA. The dataset is highly imbalanced, and various techniques were employed to ensure accurate and efficient fraud detection.

## Objective
The goal is to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent based on transaction features, helping financial institutions reduce fraud and improve security measures.

## Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset and performed feature engineering using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
- **Data Balancing**: Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to balance the imbalanced dataset and improve model performance.
- **Modeling**: Built and trained multiple classification models, including **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Random Forest**, optimizing them with **Cross- 
   Validation**.
- **Model Evaluation**: Achieved an **84% accuracy** in predicting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python** (for model development and data manipulation)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning al
